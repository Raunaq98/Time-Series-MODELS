# Time-Series-MODELS

For ***mostly or completely random*** ata, simple time series forecasting models work the best while advanced models are used to exploit trends, seasonality etc. There are 3 simple time series models:

      1. Naive Method
      2. Average Method
      3. 
      
# Naive Method

It is a ***last observation carried forward*** method. It projects the last known observation into thee future. 
For Example, to forecast Feb 2018, we usee the value of last observed Feb 2017.

# Average Method

It calculates the mean of the datapoint and projects it into the future.

# Drift Method

It calculates the difference between the first and last observation and projects it into the future.
